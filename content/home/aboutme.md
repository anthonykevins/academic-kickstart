I am currently a Marie Curie Research Fellow at [Utrecht University's](https://www.uu.nl/en/) [School of Governance](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/utrecht-university-school-of-governance), where I work with [Barbara Vis](http://www.barbaravis.nl). My project (funded by an Individual Fellowship) examines preferences for differentiated representation, seeking to uncover when and why citizens believe that certain societal groups should have their voices amplified or ignored in the policy process.

Prior to taking up my current position, I held a 3-year Assistant Professorship in the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en/) at [Aarhus University](http://au.dk/en/) in affiliation with the UNIWEL (Universalism and the Welfare State) research project. My PhD (2014) is from [McGill University's](http://www.mcgill.ca/) [Department of Political Science](http://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/), where I was supervised by [Stuart Soroka](http://www.snsoroka.com).
