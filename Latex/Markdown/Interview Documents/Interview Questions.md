Three themes should run across all answers:

1) I really want to work there (I put in the effort to prep for this)
2) They really want to work with me (I'd be a good colleague)
3) I'd be a good fit at the institution (I'd help them achieve their goals)

*ADD CONCRETE EXAMPLES TO THE VARIOUS ANSWERS, ALSO JUST IN CASE THEY ASK FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS*
*Work in references to collegiality and methodological pluralism, just in case they don't ask those precise questions* 

## Introduction

### Research Spiel

#### Public policy, inequality, and social inclusion/exclusion (1) Insider-outsider divide (2) Welfare state design and expenditure (3) Social policy preferences (4) Policy-making processes

Overall, my research centres around the connection between public policy, inequality, and social inclusion and exclusion. And then I'd divide my work up into four, sort of, sub-themes within that topic:

- first, I have research looking at the divide between groups that have historically benefited from strong state protection and those that haven't. I look at both the causes and consequences of that *insider-outsider divide*, especially ones tied to public opinion.
- second, I also have research looking directly at *welfare state design and expenditure*, often with a focus on the relationship between social policy and immigration.
- third, my research looks at the public’s *social policy preferences* and the factors that shape them - things like inequality, claims about benefit generosity, etc.
  
Finally, in my Marie Curie project, I'm looking at preferences tied to the *policy-making processes*. In particular, I'm studying reactions to consultation measures where small, marginalized groups that would be disproportionately affected by a policy change are given extra input into the drafting of that bill. So what I want to do with this project is to extend my focus on the "insider-outsider" divide from the labour market and welfare state to the democratic arena.

### ***Why do you want to work here?/Why you, why now, why this department?***

#### (1) Good fit - collaborations and research groups (2) Commitment to teaching and researching (3) England

A couple of reasons actually...

- First I feel I would be a good fit with both the Faculty and the Department in terms of research, which I think would create space for a lot of interesting *collaborations*: Will Jennings, Gerry Stoker, Matthew Ryan, Traute Meyer
- I also appreciate that you clearly take both *teaching and researching very seriously* here, I've seen your student satisfaction rates and your position in the league rankings. I actually originally got into academia through an interest in teaching, and I always envisioned myself at a department dedicated to high-quality teaching.
[//]: # (In addition, the idea of working in a *multidisciplinary environment* is something that really appeals to me. I have spent a lot of time in interdisciplinary departments and centres, and I even started out in one during my undergraduate degree.)
- Finally, I also quite like the idea of living in *England*: I completed my master's at the LSE and I really enjoyed my year there; and my father's family is actually originally from Oldham, just outside of Manchester. I'm a bit of an Anglophile, actually.

### What makes you different from the other candidates?

#### (1) 5 years post-PhD - [a] more teaching-focused (with pedagogical training), [b] then research project (2) Strong international profile - flexible/adaptive (3) Wide range of ongoing projects

- Five years of *post-PhD experience*, both in terms of researching (with a 2-year, 100% research grant) and teaching (with a 3-year assistant professorship and the formal pedagogical training I received in that role)
- *Strong international profile*, with research networks across North American and Europe. I would argue that my varied international experience also means that I'm more flexible and adaptive than the standard applicant.
- Not only do I have a large number of published works, but I also have a *wide range of ongoing projects*. I would therefore come to the department well-positioned to publish work tied to ongoing research and to apply for grants that build upon and extend my current interests.

## Research

### Who would be interested in your research theme?

#### (1) Insiders/Outsiders - inequality (2) Welfare state design - attitudinal consequences of reform [e.g. familialism] (3) Social policy preferences - political behaviour, civil society [e.g. discourse]

- I would argue that my work on the division between *insiders and outsiders* has quite broad appeal. I think it is of interest to anyone concerned with the causes and consequences of various types of *inequality*, whether tied to differences in income, social protection, or democratic influence
- When it comes to my research on *welfare state design*, I think it has potential lessons for governments, parties, and civil society actors who worry about the *long-term attitudinal consequences of different types of reforms*. I'm thinking here, for example, of my work looking at the negative impact familiastic social policies seem to have on attempts to fix gaps in welfare state coverage.
- Finally, my studies on *social policy preferences* are of interest to researchers focused on *political behaviour and the various determinants shaping public opinion*. More broadly, I believe this strand of my research has an appeal beyond academia, in particular when it comes to political parties: my work on the effects of political discourse around benefit generosity or the relationship between class and welfare state preferences, for example, strikes me as clearly relevant to political parties.

### Why do you work on this topic?

#### Family

This may not be the answer you were looking for, but my interest in the welfare state and social policy preferences is mainly tied to my *family*.

- Growing up my parents, and in particular my father, were politically active conservatives, and quite negative about the welfare state.
- When I was about 12 though, both my parents went on disability benefits, and neither of them ever returned to the workforce. Social programmes were clearly central to our getting by. Yet their anti-welfare state attitudes were surprisingly resilient, as they clearly viewed themselves as different from other beneficiaries.
- So I'd my research interests stems back to that tension as well as the clear difference the welfare state made in our lives. Ultimately, I'm interested in questions like what explains variation in social policy preferences, and who do we think should get to profit from state protection?

### Most important contribution to my subfield?/What's your best paper?

#### Socio-Economic Review (1) Careful measure of vulnerability (2) ALMP (3) Direction of causal arrow - welfare states and trust

I'd say my paper in *Socio-Economic Review* (OnlineFirst) on the relationship between labour market vulnerability, active labour market policy, and generalized trust:

- employed a *more careful measure* of labour market vulnerability to demonstrate the basic relationship between precarity and generalized trust
- and then looked at the role of *active labour market policies*, such as job training measures, on this relationship
- by doing so, I was able to weigh in on debates about whether *larger welfare states generate higher trust levels or vice versa*, showing that access to social safety net protections seems to shape trust

### Contribution to the broader literature?

#### Democratic representation (1) Bi-directional interplay (2) Value of taking economic vulnerability seriously - populism (3) Democratic insiders and outsiders

I think my clearest contribution so far is to the broader literature on *democratic representation*

- lots of work on the *bi-directional interplay* between public opinion and government legislation
- draw attention to issues surrounding insider/outsider divides, in particular by *highlighting the value of taking economic vulnerability seriously* - not simply looking at factors like income or employment status, but breaking down exposure to atypical employment and unemployment by skill and employment area
  - tied to debates about populism
- similarly, my Marie Curie project is focused on *democratic insiders and outsiders*, looking at public opinion around who should be allowed voice in policy-making decisions

### What are the big issues in your research area?

#### (1) Social policy trajectories (2) Dualization (3) Inequality - causes and consequences

- *social policy trajectories*, in particular as they relate to the increased economic vulnerability tied to both globalization and increased automation
- the welfare state *dualization* literature has been big in recent years, partly as a consequence of these trends in economic vulnerability and partly as a consequence of increasingly liberal labour market regulations
- finally, I'd also highlight the *causes and consequences of inequality* (in its various forms) as a major concern, especially given the increased popular attention the issue's received in recent years. 

### What’s next re: publications?

#### (1) R&R: [a] party appeals, [b] care work (2) Under review: [a] economic contribution of immigrants, [b] candidate class and race, [c] police guideline reforms (3) In progress: [a] workfare, [b] labour market exploitation, [c] tax bill

First, I've got several papers that are R&R'ed:

- *party appeals* to social groups (European Political Science Review)
- and interactive effects of *care work*, professionalization, and income inequality on job satisfaction (European Sociological Review)

Second, I've also got three other papers under review:

- the effects of labour market vulnerability on attitudes toward the *economic contribution of immigrants*
- voter assessments of politicians from marginalized backgrounds, looking at the potential interaction of *candidate class and race* in the Canada, the UK, and the US
- and the factors shaping public opinion toward consultations with the African American community vis-à-vis *police guideline reforms*

Finally, I have various ongoing works in progress, including papers studying:

- the relationship between *workfare* and public opinion (causes and consequences)
- the prevalence of *labour market exploitation* in Europe, broken down by education and migration 
- reactions to different consultative measures on a *tax bill* increasing the tax burden among low-income Americans 

### Do you see applying for research funding in the near future? / Experience with funding

#### Moving forward (1) [a] Leverhulme, [b] the ESRC, [c] the Carnegie Foundation (2) Stability in welfare state items - new question batteries and experiments (3) Combine dualization and democracy research - dynamics underlying populism's growing appeal

Past experience with funding:

- I currently hold a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship, funded by the European Commission via their Horizon 2020 Programme (€165 598)
- I received seed funding (with Carsten Jensen) at Aarhus University (45000 DKK) to carry out a survey experiment in the UK with over 2000 respondents
- And I was also awarded various grants from McGill University over the course of my PhD: a Guy Drummond Fellowship ($37 500, 2010-2013), awarded to carry out research in France; a Nathan Steinberg Fellowship in Political Science ($30 000, 2008-2013); and a Provost Graduate Fellowship ($2000, 2008-2009). Furthermore, I was selected to be a Research Fellow at the McGill Institute for Health and Social Policy ($5000, 2013-2014).
  
Moving forward, I would seek funding from within my first year from sources such as *Leverhulme, the ESRC, and the Carnegie Foundation*:

- First, I'll apply for funding for a project with a colleague at Essex, Seonghui Lee, studying the underlying meaning of the standard welfare state survey items. There's a *surprising amount of stability* in these items over decades, and we think there's something wrong with that. Through combining *new question batteries and survey experimentation* on question wording, we feel we can help to refine future survey-based work and help us to better understand existing findings on social policy preferences.
- Second, I want to *bring together my work on dualization and my work on democracy*, looking at how economic vulnerability and racial resentment interact to shape ideas about how policies should be made and implemented. In particular, I think past work on this subject has failed to incorporate insights from the dualization literature, and as a result has conceived of economic vulnerability in overly simplistic terms. Ultimately, I think this project can help us to better understand the *dynamics underlying populism’s growing appeal* and its practical significance for democratic governance.

### How do I evaluate research in my area?

#### (1) Comparative work - cross-country differences in policy (2) Quantitative - properly connects (3) Tied to real-world debates and issues

- First, in *comparative* work, I consider whether the article demonstrates an understanding of *cross-country differences in policy design* and the provision of social services
- Second, if the article uses *quantitative* data, does it do so in a way that *properly connects* the analysis to both the research questions and the conclusions.
- Finally, does the article explain how it is *tied to real-world debates and issues*? Not all articles have to do so, of course - sometimes purely theoretical research helps build the foundation for future work. But I still think that, most of the time, such connections should be possible and should be drawn out explicitly.

[how does my research overcome these issues?]

### Where do you see yourself in 10 years' time?

#### (1) Senior lecturer here (2) Democratic insiders and outsiders (3) Appeal of Populism and illiberal democracy

- Well ideally, I'd like to be a *senior Lecturer* here.
- But more generally, my medium-term goal is to help build up a literature around *democratic insiders and outsiders* that is comparable to research on welfare state and labour market insider/outsider divisions. And specifically, I want to do so by focussing on concrete democratic preferences tied to real-world democratic processes.
- By drawing from the literatures on welfare state and labour market dualization, I think there are important insights to be made on this topic that will help us to better understand the appeal of *populism and illiberal democracy*.

## Colleagues/Service

### Contribution to the Department? / How do you see yourself fitting into the Department?

#### (1) Committed to collegial environment - [a] research groups and [b] curriculum development (2) Variety of methodological approaches (3) Very approachable person

- commitment to a *collegial environment* for both teaching and research
  - Helped to create various *research groups and workshops*, and also sat on *curriculum development committees* in Research Methods and Comparative Politics
- I think that the *variety of methodological approaches* I’ve tied together in my research thus far would also help me not only to fit in well with faculty with different methodological leanings, but also to teach methods courses on a range of topics
- Finally, I also think I'm a *very approachable person*, always ready to lend a hand to both students and other staff. I'm really committed to the idea that the department should feel like a real community.

### ***Who would I collaborate with at the Department?***

#### (1) Will Jennings - opinion-policy (2) Gerry Stoker and Matthew Ryan - democracy/participation (3) Faculty - Traute Meyer - welfare

I think there would be a lot of space for fruitful collaborations actually. I would argue that the most obvious people to work with are:

- Will Jennings: public opinion and responsiveness
- Gerry Stoker and Matthew Ryan: citizen participation and democratic innovations
- Within the broader Faculty, Traute Meyer: shared focus on comparative welfare state studies

### Willing to work with colleagues who take different approaches?

#### Pluralist - describe methods experience

- Definitely. I think all research approaches have the potential to bring something different to the table.
- I'm *also someone who has done very different sorts of research*: I've done purely qualitative work, based off of elite interviewing and archival research; I've done purely quantitative research, for example via survey experimentation and hierarchical modelling; and I've also done mixes of the two. So I definitely wouldn't describe myself as a person with a narrow approach to research.

### What is my experience with administrative service?

#### (1) Research groups - [a] Public Policy and Welfare, [b] Political Institutions, Behaviour, and Decision Making (2) Curriculum development - [a] Research Methods, [b] Comparative Politics

My experience with departmental service includes contributions on both research and teaching initiatives.

With regard to research, I have helped to organize various discussion forums:
- I chaired a *research group* on Public Policy and Welfare at Aarhus University, where researchers at the Department were invited to present article and grant ideas for feedback
- I co-organized a *workshop* on the Middle Class and the Welfare State (also at Aarhus), which included about a dozen invitees from Europe and North America
- and I am currently co-chair of a *research group* on Political Institutions, Behaviour, and Decision Making at Utrecht, which gives faculty and PhD students an opportunity to circulate papers, chapters, and grant proposals for comments.

With regard to teaching, my most notable contributions were made as a member of two curriculum development committees at Aarhus:
- On the *Research Methods* committee, we coordinated the methodological curriculum offered by the Department of Political Science to ensure consistency across levels and topics.
- As a member of the *Comparative Politics* committee, in turn, I was part of a four-person team that developed a new core course for students pursuing a major or minor in Political Science.
  - This task involved:
    - syllabus- and compendium-development over the course of several semesters
    - teaching and classroom organization (for a group of over 300 students taught by 4 lecturers and 5 teaching assistants)
    - and working in tandem with other core course teachers to ensure cross-programme alignment in topics and teaching goals

## Impact

### Practical implications for society?

#### Who deserves collective support (1) Impact of coverage gaps and vulnerability (2) Welfare state - reduce/reinforce/generate inequality (3) Factors preventing reform

- My research activity is centred around an issue with profound implications for politics, society, and the labour market: *who deserves our collective support?* I thus explore the relationship between public policy, inequality, and the division between those who we deem worthy of solidarity and those who we exclude from it, which I think are topics with natural relevance.
- *impact of coverage gaps and labour market vulnerability* on people’s lives, especially youth, women, and immigrants, as they are more likely to be in atypical work
- the welfare state’s conflicting capacity to *reduce, reinforce, or even generate inequality*, depending on the design of social policy
- for those concerned with these issues, my research points out some important *factors that stand in the way of reform,* thereby helping to draw out potential routes forward.

[potentially combine with next answer]

### How do you reach out to society?

#### (1) Department of Health and Care (2) Blogs - [a] LSE [b] Policy & Politics (3) Newspapers - [a] Globe [b] Maclean's (4) Future: [a] Monkey Cage on police brutality [b] opinion piece on universalism

My community engagement has primarily taken the form of knowledge dissemination. 

- For example, in 2015 I volunteered to give an hour-long presentation at the *Department of Health and Care* of the Municipality of Aarhus (Denmark’s second biggest city). During this talk, I provided requested background information on eldercare and healthcare policies in the US in preparation for a consultation the Department was about to undertake in California. 
- Similarly, I also try to make my research findings accessible to civil society actors and the general public, for example by writing a post for the *LSE’s British Politics & Policy blog* (2018) and the Policy & Politics (in revision).
- Perhaps most notably, I also had my research on social policy preferences in Canada discussed in the *Globe & Mail* (2015) and *Macleans* (2019) after a journalist reached out.

Over the next few months, I also plan to:

- submit a write up of a study on the desired influence of African Americans on police guidelines to the *Washington Post's monkey cage*
- as well as an opinion piece to a Canadian newspaper on the importance of *universalist social policy*. 
[funding for organizing workshops and other events available?]

## Teaching

### Approach to teaching?

#### Three central concepts (1) Constructive alignment - [a] theoretical knowledge, [b] empirical knowledge, [c] application (2) Active learning activities - [a] quizzes + peer discussion, [b] flipped classrooms, [c] muddiest point (3) Open dialogue with students - [a] explanation, [b] informal feedback

Three concepts are central to my teaching:

- First, *constructive alignment*
  - Political Institutions example
  - intended learning objectives specified in advance, ideally for each session, and overall alignment with the examination methods
  - broken down into expectations concerning theoretical knowledge, empirical knowledge, and application
- Second, *active learning activities*
  - questions of understanding: activities include online quizzes (followed by peer and then class-wide discussions), flipped classroom activities where students do the teaching, and reflections on the “muddiest” point of the lesson.
  - theory application: preparation of small written assignments or group presentations, built around peer feedback
- Finally, *open dialogue with students*
  - expressly making the case for the teaching activities I employ and offering students the chance to provide informal, anonymous feedback after the first month of the semester
  - creates a greater openness to new activities on their part (e.g. peer feedback) as well as a classroom experience that they feel more invested in and, as a result, more satisfied with

### If I were to come into your classroom, what would I see? What do you do that is unusual or particularly effective?

#### Two modes (1) Dynamism/boardwork (2) Peer feedback and teaching

I would say I'm a teacher with *two modes*:

- When I'm playing a larger active role in teaching, I think I'm someone who really tries to keep the *dynamism* going through using a rather high energy approach, for instance through an almost obsessive use of *boardwork*.
- But most of the time, I have students play the central role.
  - On the one hand, I put a lot of emphasis on things like group exercises, debates, and presentations.
  - On the other, I also make *peer feedback and teaching* the cornerstone of my lessons, using, for example, flipped classroom activities, writing workshops, or online quizzes as starting points for student interaction. In my experience, this helps students to better internalize the course material and develop the capacity to better refine their own work.

### Tell us how your research has influenced your teaching. In what ways have you been able to bring the insights of your research to courses at the undergraduate level?

#### (1) Incorporate interests - specialization needed for deep exploration (2) Upper level courses build from research questions

- I bring *some of my research interests into almost all of the courses I teach*, especially as I want to ensure that students have a chance to interact with some of the course material in a particularly deep manner, as is made possible only by *specialization*.
- What is more, most of my *new upper-level* courses have often been intricately tied to my ongoing research. I will often *build a course off of research questions* I feel are obvious progressions from my existing work - for example, developing a course on Democracy and Representation after publishing some of my research on the opinion-policy link, which in turn led me toward my current Marie Curie topic.

### How would you motivate students to get interested in your main research theme?

#### Explain relevance of topic (1) Individual level - implications of insider-outsider divide (2) Societal level - path dependency and policy

Explain the *relevance* of the topic for both individuals and society:

- At the *individual-level*, social policy and the various *insider-outsider* divisions have profound implications for *people's everyday lives*, ranging from how they think about politics to whether or not they have enough money to get by that month.
- At the *societal-level*, my research helps us to better understand the *direction* we're moving in as a democracy, the opportunities to get off of our current track, and the potential medium- and long-term implications of the political decisions we take today.

### How to attract students to the programme?

#### More than just debating politics (1) Methodological training (2) Substantive political knowledge (3) Critical reasoning skills

Explain that while political science often involves talking about politics, it offers *much more than that*:

- *Methodological training* that will help them to answer research questions that are not only interesting to them, but that have the potential to help governments, think tanks, and parties steer politics.
- Develop the *substantive political knowledge* needed to better understand the world around them, building up a framework of understanding that they will spend the rest of their lives building upon.
- Refine their *critical reasoning* and research skills, which will serve them well both in the democratic arena and in the labour market.

### How to attract students to your courses?

#### (1) Intended learning objectives - real-world skills (2) Research topics - broad appeal (3) Teaching approach - dynamism and active student learning

- Careful course design:
  - *intended learning objectives* that are clearly and easily *tied to real-world skills* that students will need after their degree
  - *research topics* that have a *broad appeal* and have an obvious connection to political developments in the world around them.
- Making sure that the students who enrol in my class each year leave the course *wanting to have me again*:
  - I think my *dynamic* approach to teaching with a particular emphasis on *active student learning* is especially helpful here.

### How to balance textbook vs. research articles in syllabus?

#### (1) Introduction - start from textbook, then supplement (2) Large core courses - textbook in lecture, article in tutorials (3) Upper levels - textbook only for research design and methods

Depends on the level of the course and the intended learning objectives, obviously. As a general rule, though:

- For courses where were *introducing and describing basic concepts, methods, or institutional differences*, I would be inclined to start from a *text* book and then supplement those readings with the odd article or book excerpt to provide potential applications.
- In large core courses, this distinction would involve more of a *textbook focus in lectures* and an *article/theory application focus in tutorials*. This is what we did in Political Institutions, for example.  
- At *upper* levels, however, I'd tend to rely on *textbooks only in research design and methods courses*, where the goal is to learn technical skills.

### Can you give examples of some challenging classroom situations you have faced; and how you dealt with them; and what you learned from them?

#### Student involvement (1) Bridge from group to class (2) Gate-way questions - no more big talkers (3) Positive reinforcement (4) Key/lesson - open dialogue

- biggest issue is probably difficulties encouraging *student involvement*, especially where the interactive dynamic seems particularly troubled for whatever reason (Political Institutions): students silent in class, possibly due to not doing readings, possibly due to shyness.
- small group work tended to generally go well, but as a whole class there were more difficulties
  - try to *bridge* the discussion from the group to the class level
- consistently include *gate-way questions*: “what is the author's main point?”
- I then stop taking answers on these questions from the big talkers after a few weeks, informing the students of the goal to spread participation
- provide *positive reinforcement* for all comments
- key lesson drawn: *open dialogue* to reinforce the importance of participation (and of doing readings)

### How would you deal with students from diverse backgrounds?

#### (1) Sensitive to dynamic - make space (women, ESL) (2) Design course to broadly appeal - [a] beyond West, [b] family migration project

- First off, sensitive to the risk that students with certain types of backgrounds will *dominate* the class
  - for example, purposefully *make more space for women* and people with *English as their second language* to try to correct for these imbalances
- Second, *design course to have broad appeal*
  - my own research interests are helpful here, given my focus on *outsiders* and other marginalized groups
  - but I'm also careful to include research from *beyond the Anglo countries and Europe*.
    - This helps me to ensure that the course material connects with students, though it can also be done through activities:
      - E.g., for a *project looking at migration*, have students investigate their own family migration patterns and the push and pull factors that drove those moves.

### ***What courses would I like to teach?***

#### Democracy (1) Crick and political theory (2) Place of political science vs. politics (3) Contested policy area examples (4) Goal: contribution of political science research to democracy

[Name existing courses, then refer to ones I've taught but they don't have, then name a dream course]

- Dream course (*DEMOCRACY*):
  - like to build a course that circles around *Bernard Crick's "In Defence of Politics"*, combining empirical debates in the literature with a bit of political theory
    - e.g. Alasdair MacIntyre (After Virtue), Robert Dahl (A Democratic Dilemma [article]), Ian Shapiro (Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences)
  - examine the *place of political science versus politics*, drawing out tensions between democracy and our (often) technocratic inclinations as social scientists
  - explore the boundaries of applying political science research to policy issues by looking at several *contested policy areas* (e.g. immigration and the welfare state)
  - raise questions about what we should be trying to do as political scientists, both when we conduct research and when we try to take lessons from it
  - *Goal*: assess the potential role and contributions of political science in a democratic society and to become familiar with the tensions between technocracy and democracy.

- Dream course (SOCIAL POLICY):
  - incorporate the role of ideas into a historical institutionalist approach to welfare state development
  - approach the issue using a bit of theory spread over the semester – starting with Marx, Tawney, and Marshall (e.g. "Citizenship and Social Class") and then later including work by Rawls, Nozick, and Cohen
  - discussion of what it means to be deserving of support
  - discussion of the role of morality in welfare state design
  - an analysis of changing gender norms and increasing ethnic diversity in Europe as well
  - Goal: chart out the conceptual development of the welfare state and highlight some potential routes forward

### Approach to teaching methods courses?

#### (1) Closer to student interests (2) Practice via group work and mini-projects (3) Quantitative and qualitative (3) Textbook - [a] Social Research: An Introduction, [b] Empirical Political Analysis

Obviously not the most popular course for students, but teaching them gives an opportunity to *get closer to students own research interests*.

I also find that having students put the techniques we study into *practice via group work and mini-projects* helps quite a bit in generating interest and showing students why the material is important.

Can teach the course with a more *quantitative or qualitative* inclination, depending on the preferences of the faculty...

- *Experience with varied methods*:
  - Archival research, elite interviewing, multi-level modelling, survey experimentation, duration analysis, etc. - often employed in the *mixed-methods* research.
  - Comfortable in *Stata and R*, training from: Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis (2015); the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship (2013-2014); the Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (2010); McGill University (2008-2010).

- *Textbook*:
  - Have teaching experience using a mixture of articles and textbook readings (about 50% each) using *Social Research: An Introduction* from David and Matthew (2011).
  - I’m also familiar with *Empirical Political Analysis* from Rich et al., which I used myself during grad school (2018)
  - Of course flexible though

### What will be the first student research project that you supervise?

#### Social policy, vulnerability, public opinion - appeal of open vs. closed

I think a thesis on *social policy, economic vulnerability, and public opinion* would be an obvious first project. I feel like the divide between open versus closed citizens, remainers versus leavers, however you'd like to label it, has made these topics particularly interesting to students.

## Conclusion

### What are the top three things I look for in an academic job?

#### (1) Interaction with diverse students (2) Research with an impact (3) Friendly and mutually supportive atmosphere

- first, an ability to have a *lot of interactions with students from a diversity of backgrounds* to really add a dynamism to each version of the course I teach.
- second, an ability to *conduct research that could have an impact in the world*, ideally in a context where faculty- or university-based outreach initiatives would help me to connect with civil society in new and exciting ways.
- finally, *a friendly and mutually supportive atmosphere* among faculty in the department, with a lot of open doors in the hallways and a workshop environment where we help one another to advance all of our teaching, research, and funding goals.

### What is your definition of a “good academic citizen”?/What does collegiality mean to you?

#### (1) Make academia better (2) Openness to difference (3) Raise quality of collective knowledge

- Someone who is trying to *make academia a better place*.
